# PES-Assignment-6
In this Assignment UART initializing was implemented and the data was transferred from Freedom KL25Z to TERA TERM
UART intialization was implemented as follows:
Baud rate:38400
Data bits :8
Stop bits:2
Parity bit:0
Following Commands were Implemented, All commands are case sensitive</br>
Command: Author.</br>
Functionality: Prints Name of Author.</br>
Command:Dump start address length.</br>
